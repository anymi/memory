# Memory

Simple matching game. My first attempt to learn iOS and xcode.

Built by following along [Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift By Paul Hegarty][1].

## To run

1. clone
2. open `Memory.xcodeproj` in xcode.
3. `Cmd-b` to build an `Cmd-r` to run.

## Todo

- [ ] color/holiday themes
- [ ] an ending
